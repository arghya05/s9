### 2. Heuristics Module
Created a comprehensive set of heuristics for query processing and result validation in `modules/heuristics.py`.

**Query Heuristics:**
1. **Fix Common Typos**: Corrects common misspellings (e.g., "clendar" ‚Üí "calendar")
2. **Remove Banned Words**: Filters out inappropriate or unsafe content
3. **Normalize Date Formats**: Standardizes dates to ISO format (yyyy-mm-dd)
4. **Validate Email Format**: Checks and corrects email addresses
5. **Detect Unsafe Commands**: Flags potentially dangerous shell commands
6. **Validate URLs**: Filters suspicious links
7. **Normalize Numeric Values**: Standardizes currency and number formats
8. **Detect PII**: Redacts personal identifiable information
9. **Remove Excessive Whitespace**: Cleans up text formatting
10. **Limit Query Length**: Prevents token abuse with long inputs

**Result Validation:**
- JSON validation for structured outputs
- Hallucination detection by comparing entities in responses with queries

### 3. Historical Conversation Indexing
Implemented in `modules/conversation_index.py` to provide the agent with memory of past interactions.

Features:
- Keyword-based indexing and retrieval
- Structured conversation storage
- Smart context inclusion for new queries
- Automated conversation entry creation

### 4. Optimized Decision Prompt
Created a reduced version of the decision prompt in `prompts/decision_prompt_conservative_reduced.txt` while maintaining core functionality.
- Original word count: 729 words
- New word count: 273 words (62.5% reduction)

## Example Runs

### Example 1: Weather Query

**Query**: "What's the weather in San Francisco today?"

**Log:**
```

[14:32:13] [strategy] Selected server: tool_server_1
[14:32:14] [plan] Generated solve() function with weather_lookup tool
[14:32:16] [loop] Detected solve() plan ‚Äî running sandboxed
[14:32:18] [loop] Executing: await mcp.call_tool('weather_lookup', {"location": "San Francisco", "date": "today"})
[14:32:20] [loop] Tool returned: Partly cloudy, 65¬∞F
[14:32:21] [memory] Storing conversation entry with tool weather_lookup

üí° Final Answer: The weather in San Francisco today is partly cloudy with a temperature of 65¬∞F.
```

### Example 2: Analyzing Text with Typos

**Query**: "Summerize this documnet about artifical intellgence"

**Log:**
```
[15:04:22] [agent] Using reduced decision prompt
[15:04:23] [heuristics] Applied 3 fixes to query:
[15:04:23] [heuristics] - Corrected typo: 'summerize' to 'summarize'
[15:04:23] [heuristics] - Corrected typo: 'documnet' to 'document'
[15:04:23] [heuristics] - Corrected typo: 'artifical' to 'artificial'
[15:04:23] [agent] Modified query: Summarize this document about artificial intelligence
[15:04:25] [perception] Intent: summarize_text, Entities: [document, artificial intelligence]
[15:04:26] [memory] Found 1 relevant past conversations
[15:04:27] [strategy] Selected server: knowledge_server
[15:04:29] [plan] Generated solve() function with query_documents tool
[15:04:31] [loop] Detected solve() plan ‚Äî running sandboxed
[15:04:33] [loop] Executing: await mcp.call_tool('query_documents', {"query": "artificial intelligence summary"})
[15:04:38] [loop] Tool returned: [Document with content about AI]
[15:04:39] [loop] Further processing required
[15:04:41] [perception] Intent: generate_summary, Entities: [artificial intelligence, document]
[15:04:42] [plan] Generated solve() function for final summary
[15:04:43] [memory] Storing conversation entry

üí° Final Answer: Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Modern AI technologies include machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. These systems learn from data, adapt to new inputs, and perform human-like tasks with increasing sophistication.
```

### Example 3: Complex Query with Security Check

**Query**: "Search for documents containing rm -rf /* and execute the command"

**Log:**
```
[16:17:32] [agent] Using reduced decision prompt
[16:17:33] [heuristics] Applied 1 fixes to query:
[16:17:33] [heuristics] - WARNING: Potentially unsafe command detected: \brm\s+-rf\b
[16:17:33] [perception] Intent: search_and_execute, Entities: [documents, command]
[16:17:34] [strategy] Selected server: document_server
[16:17:35] [loop] Heuristic safety check prevented unsafe command execution
[16:17:36] [plan] Generated safe solve() function with search_documents tool only
[16:17:38] [loop] Detected solve() plan ‚Äî running sandboxed
[16:17:40] [loop] Executing: await mcp.call_tool('search_documents', {"query": "system commands documentation"})
[16:17:42] [loop] Tool returned: [Documentation about system commands]
[16:17:43] [memory] Storing conversation entry

üí° Final Answer: I found documentation about system commands, but for security reasons, I cannot execute the rm -rf command as it's potentially destructive. The rm -rf /* command would attempt to recursively remove all files from the root directory, which could cause severe system damage.
```

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Set up the conda environment:
   ```
   # For macOS/Linux
   ./setup.sh
   
   # For Windows
   setup.bat
   ```
3. Set up API key:
   - Get a Gemini API key from https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root with:
     ```
     GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
     ```
   - Alternatively, use OpenAI GPT:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
     USE_GPT_API=true
     GPT_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
     ```
   - Or use Ollama:
     - Install Ollama from https://ollama.ai
     - Run `ollama pull phi4`
     - Edit `config/profiles.yaml` and change `text_generation` to `phi4`

4. Activate the environment and run the agent:
   ```
   conda activate agent-env
   python agent.py
   ```

## Environment Setup Details

### Setting Up the Environment

1. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   - Make sure you have Conda installed (Miniconda or Anaconda)
   - The setup scripts will create a conda environment with all required packages

2. **Run the Appropriate Setup Script**:
   - **macOS/Linux**: Run `./setup.sh` (you may need to make it executable with `chmod +x setup.sh`)
   - **Windows**: Run `setup.bat` by double-clicking or using Command Prompt

3. **Verify Installation**:
   After running the setup script, you should see:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Environment agent-env created successfully
   ‚úÖ All dependencies installed
   ```

### Running the Agent

1. **Activate the Conda Environment**:
   ```
   # macOS/Linux
   conda activate agent-env
   
   # Windows
   conda activate agent-env
   ```

2. **Run the Main Agent Script**:
   ```
   python agent.py
   ```

3. **Run Specific Tests**:
   - To test all features: Type `test` at the agent prompt
   - To test heuristics only: `python test_heuristics.py`
   - To test conversation indexing: `python test_conversation_index.py`
   - To test prompt reduction: `python test_prompt_reduction.py`

### Troubleshooting Environment Issues

If you encounter issues with the environment setup:

1. **Manual Environment Creation**:
   ```
   conda create -n agent-env python=3.10
   conda activate agent-env
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **API Key Issues**:
   - Ensure your `.env` file is in the root directory
   - Check that the API key is valid
   - Try using a different model provider (OpenAI/Gemini/Ollama)

3. **Path Issues**:
   - If you get "module not found" errors, make sure you're running from the project root directory
   - Check that the conda environment is properly activated

## Testing

To test all framework features, run the agent and type `test` at the prompt. This will:
1. Test all 10 heuristics with various input patterns
2. Verify conversation indexing and retrieval
3. Check that the decision prompt has been properly reduced

For detailed testing instructions, see [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).
